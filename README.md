A simple code to send mass emails with different targets and files with references from .csv data.

# How-to-Install?
Step 1: Prepare the necessary files and folders
- Create a new folder to store the files to be attached. For example, name it files.
- Create a new CSV file to store the target email addresses and file names. For example, name it targets.csv
- Place the files folder and targets.csv file in the same directory as your Python script.

Step 2: Create the targets.csv file
- Open the targets.csv file in a text editor or spreadsheet software.
- Add the target email addresses and file names, see example on targets.csv

Step 3: Replace Email & File Path
- Replace your_email@gmail.com and your_app_password with your actual Gmail account credentials and app password.
- Replace path/to/files with the actual path to the files folder.
- Replace path/to/targets.csv with the actual path to the targets.csv file.

Step 4: Run the Python script
- Run the send_emails.py file by executing the following command: py send_emails.py or python send_emails.py

Step 5: Check your sent emails
